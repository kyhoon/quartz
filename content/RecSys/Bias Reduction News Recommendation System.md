## Abstract

News recommender systems (NRS) are crucial for helping users navigate the vast amount of content available online. However, traditional NRS often suffer from biases that lead to a narrow and unfair distribution of exposure across news items. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Contextual-Dual Bias Reduction Recommendation System (C-DBRRS), which leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks optimized with a multi-objective function to balance accuracy and diversity. We conducted experiments on two real-world news recommendation datasets and the results indicate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves higher accuracy while promoting a fair and balanced distribution of recommendations. This work contributes to the development of a fair and responsible recommendation system.
