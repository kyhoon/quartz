## Abstract

An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced goods – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems. The dataset can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml_belief_2024/.

## Introduction

Previous research has shown that one useful type of data for understanding user choice and the mechanisms through which recommendations act is **user belief** data — the opinions that users have about goods they have not consumed.

Our Contributions: In this paper we provide both a procedure to effectively collect belief data and an open-source dataset generated by implementing the procedure on the MovieLens platform for over a year. We rely on a simple **economic model** of decision-making in the context of recommender systems to guide the type of variation that is generated by our procedure.

## Procedure

Each time the consumer enters the platform, they receive a set of recommendations, denoted 𝑟𝑖,𝑡. For now, we remain agnostic to how this set is generated. We consider that the recommendation directly shifts the user’s beliefs so that the user’s expected utility following the set of recommendations is given by E𝑝𝑖 [𝑢𝑖(𝑥𝑖,𝑛) | 𝑟𝑖,𝑡].

we want to design the procedure so that we have the necessary variation to (1) characterize the set of prior beliefs over the space of goods, (2) predict how beliefs map to consumption, and (3) identify how recommendations shift beliefs.

**Choosing the Set of Goods**

The exact size of 𝑀𝑡 is calibrated by a parameter 𝑦. The criteria for inclusion are the following:
* **All-time popularity**: the 50𝑦 most popular movies within the different genres 𝐺. Popularity is determined by the number of ratings. For each genre 𝑔, the ceil(𝑠𝑔 · 50𝑦) movies with the most ratings within the genre.
* **Rating**: the 25𝑦 movies with the highest rating score within the different genres 𝐺. 3 For each genre 𝑔, select the ceil(𝑠𝑔 · 25𝑦) highest rating score within the genre.
* **Popular recent releases**: the 10𝑦 most popular, recently released movies within the different genres𝐺. For each genre 𝑔, select the ceil(𝑠𝑔·10𝑦) most rated movies that were released within the genre.
* **Trendy releases**: the 10𝑦 ‘trendiest’ movies within the different genres 𝐺. For each genre 𝑔, select ceil(𝑠𝑔 · 10𝑦) movies with the highest trendy score within the genre.
* **Serendipity**: 5𝑦 movies uniformly sampled within the different genres 𝐺. For each genre 𝑔, select ceil(𝑠𝑔 · 5𝑦) sampled uniformly at random within the genre.

This leads to having 𝑀𝑡 with approximately 100𝑦 movies.

**Choosing Elicited Goods**

At any given period, we present 8 movies to user 𝑖 to elicit beliefs about, 𝐵 𝑡 𝑖 , chosen from 𝑀𝑡 . This appears as a row on the platform’s homepage. If a user refreshes the page, it generates a new set 𝐵 𝑡 𝑖 , replacing the movies for which beliefs were already elicited.

We choose the set of movies to elicit beliefs about for a user at a given time period 𝑡, 𝐵 𝑡 𝑖 , according to the following principles:
* **Broad Sampling**: 3 movies from 𝑀𝑡 𝑖 uniformly at random.
* **Elicitation with possible recommendation**: 4 movies from 𝑅 𝑡 𝑖 sampled uniformly at random from the top 𝑛 according to their top picks (where 𝑛 = 100). This serves the goal of generating variation in the set of elicited movies that may also possibly be recommended, while also sampling from more niche movies due to individual-level heterogeneity in user recommendations.
* **Sample New Movies**: 1 movie from 𝑀𝑡 𝑖 that is a recent release.

## Data

**Data Collection Details** ... The only change is that our intervention changes the second row of the homepage of the platform to ask users about the movies chosen by the procedure.

The data collection began at the start of March 2023 and concluded in May 2024 . We began the data collection by setting 𝑦 = 100 for 𝑀𝑡 , but revised this down to 𝑦 = 11 in July 2023 once we had a better sense of users’ response rates.

**Datasets** ... The dataset contains the following fields, beyond the timestamp and user/movie identifiers:
* isSeen: This is −1 if the user did not respond, 0 if the user marked that they had not seen the movie, and 1 if the user marked that they had seen the movie.
* userElicitRating / watchDate: This is the rating the user gave for the movie and the time they claim to have seen it.
* userPredictRating / userCertainty: This is the predicted rating and certainty level the user has conditional on them not having seen the movie.

In addition, we provide ratings data that has a similar structure to the main MovieLens ratings datasets that have historically been released by GroupLens, except that the set of users are those that provided at least one belief data point.
